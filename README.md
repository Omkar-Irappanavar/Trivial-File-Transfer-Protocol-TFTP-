# Trivial-File-Transfer-Protocol-TFTP-
Developed a TFTP client-server in C supporting connect, get, put, mode and exit commands. Server runs in the background silently. Implemented Normal(512 bytes), Octet(byte-by-byte) and Net-Ascii(Newline conversion) modes using UDP sockets, file I/O and system calls for efficient file transfer.
